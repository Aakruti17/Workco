This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python, 
designed for two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid.
The objective is to place three of your marks (X or O) in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
This game features a straightforward command-line interface and provides clear messages for wins and draws. 
Future enhancements may include implementing an AI opponent for single-player mode, 
adding a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Pygame or Tkinter, and incorporating score tracking and player statistics. 
Contributions are welcome; simply fork the repository, create a new branch for your feature, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
